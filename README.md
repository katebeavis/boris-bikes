# Boris Bikes

Boris Bikes was my week one project at Makers Academy. It is a simulation of the Boris Bikes Rental system in London.

# Objectives

To learn about Object-Orientated-Programming and Test-Driven-Development.

# Technology
- Ruby
- Rspec
- Git

# To Run
```
$ git clone git@github.com:katebeavis/boris-bikes.git
$ cd boris-bikes
$ irb
    > Dir['./lib/*.rb'].each {|file| require file }
```

Now you are able to play around with the objects in Ruby. These are:
- Bike
- Docking Station
- Van
- Garage

# To Run Tests
```
$ rspec
```
